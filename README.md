# WaniKani Kanji Highlighter
### Unofficial Chrome Extension

This is an unofficial chrome extension for Kanji Highlighting, matching the kanji learned with [WaniKani.com](https://www.wanikani.com/).
It works with any website, and provides detailed information about any kanji that is highlighted.
**Because it would be cheating, the extension doesn't work on [WaniKani.com](https://www.wanikani.com/).**
